1. caculate_frequency(), use a dict stor frequency info. time complexity O(n).
2. Build and sort a list of node from lowest to highest frequencies, time complexity O(nlog(n))
3. Build binary huff tree, time complextiy O(n).
4. huffman_encoding(), encode function, time complexity O(n).
5. huffman_decoding(), timecomplexity O(n).
