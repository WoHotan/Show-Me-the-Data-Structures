1. Use a set() get all link list node value, and the create new link list. n represent the number of node here, so time complexity O(n).
2. Use set() stored two link list node value separately, ant then create new link list use the intersection of two set. n represent the number of node here, time complexity O(n).
3. This implementation requires additional space to store nodes, and the space complexity is O(n).
